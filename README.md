This iOS application used Stepper and DatePicker UI elements to gather user input. Create ML and Core ML were used to determine relations between the user inputted data set and a stored data set. The application prompts the user for their desired time to wake up, desired amount of sleep and daily coffee intake to output an ideal bedtime.
